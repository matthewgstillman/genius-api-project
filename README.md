# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE SERVER CODE - CORS ANYWHERE SOLUTION

Install CORS Anywhere:

First, you need to clone the CORS Anywhere repository and install its dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere.git
cd cors-anywhere
npm install
Run CORS Anywhere Server:

Start the CORS Anywhere server. By default, it runs on port 8080:

bash
Copy code
npm start

WHY:

This avoids all the cors errors involved in making requests from the client to genius api.  

The first request https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize doesn't matter that it is from the client,
it is just a redirect.

Once we get redirected back to our localhost:3030 and have the 'code', we could send requests to our server 'server.js' from our client 
to genius (like /oauth/token).  If we send direct from client we see CORS errors.  Instead of messing with
the server code we just throw CORS anywhere as our proxy server.  Bad for production, good for testing.

So we 'npm start' inside that new cors anywhere project and it spins up a server.

await axios.get('http://localhost:8080/https://api.genius.com/account'

Server is listening on 'http://localhost:8080', then we pipe through our request to get a proper response.

Really we should setup our server to listen and use all this.
